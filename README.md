## Releases

Check [the releases page](https://github.com/gkr-labs/vikkuna/releases)


## Lineage

This is a fork of the original (v0) Alpakka with a few modifications to satisfy my household's gaming needs

Its maintained as the smallest possible set of patches atop the Alpakka project

Changes include:

- USB-C

- Additional thumbstick

- Simpler touch surface

- Different shape and or position of buttons, thumbsticks, triggers and case

The latest iteration (v1) of the Alpakka removes the need for most of these changes and has a multitude of worthwhile new features

Please support the official release
